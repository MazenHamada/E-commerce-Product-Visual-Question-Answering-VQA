# E-commerce Product Visual Question Answering (VQA) Analysis


## üìù Overview
This project analyzes user query patterns from the **VQA v2.0 dataset** to simulate how an e-commerce platform could optimize its customer experience. The goal is to understand what users ask about products and identify potential weaknesses in a VQA system. All analysis is contained within a single Jupyter Notebook.

## üöÄ Key Tasks Performed
- **Data Exploration**: Loaded and inspected the structure of all question, answer, and complementary pair files.
- **Query Pattern Analysis**: Analyzed the most common types of questions and product attributes (color, material, size) users are interested in.
- **Weakness Identification**: Identified "unanswered" or "poorly answered" questions by analyzing answer agreement and confidence scores.
- **Merchandising Reports**: Generated a data-driven PDF report for a simulated merchandising team, highlighting the "most requested colors".
- **Business Impact Simulation**: Outlined a framework for measuring the business impact (CTR, A/B testing) of a VQA system in a live environment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/VQA-E-commerce-Analysis.git](https://github.com/your-username/VQA-E-commerce-Analysis.git)
    cd VQA-E-commerce-Analysis
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Download the Data:**
    The large VQA annotation files are not included in this repository. Please download the **`v2_Annotations.zip`** file from the official [**VQA dataset website**](https://visualqa.org/download.html). After unzipping, place the annotation files in the `/data` directory.

## üìñ Usage
All the analysis, from data loading to final reporting, is performed within the **`VQA_Analysis_Notebook.ipynb`** file. Open this notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab and run the cells sequentially to reproduce the results.

## ‚ú® Key Findings
A key finding was that **color** is the most frequently queried product attribute. The report generated in the notebook provides detailed recommendations for a merchandising team based on the top 10 most requested colors.
